    Hi, I'm Mela! I am a real estate agent serving Cumming-GA and the
    surrounding areas, with a keen interest in creating delicious, vegan meals!
    My desire and wish for you is to fall in love with eating healthy! 
intro:
  heading: More Information

    I was born and raised in Transilvannia-Romania! My love and inspiration for
    cooking healthy  comes from my mother, who knew just about every wild edible
    herb, mushroom, berry, or grass. She knew when to pick it, and how to use it
    for the best taste and nutritional benefits. At the time I did't see the
    importance of her talent, but after I moved to the USA, I realized that none
    of us, 5 children plus parents, were ever sick needing hospitalization. 

    However, as I got busy with "more important stuff" and neglected to cook
    healthy, I began to experience unpleasant changes that made me nostalgic
    after the old ways. Today, I am a happy wife and proud mother of two
    wonderful children, and though my family and I are not fully vegan(yet), my
    recipes here are all vegan. They will include a variety of grains, beans,
    lentils, nuts, vegetables and herbs. I am always happy when I can create
    tasty recipes that are gluten and soy free.
